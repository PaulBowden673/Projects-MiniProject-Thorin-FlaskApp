    <h2>About Page</h2>
    <p>The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest
        in recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the king of the Lonely Mountain
        when Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the
        Shire, Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to
        force. Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from
        rash action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had
        planned to leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

            <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
			<p>
				In the year TA 2746, Thorin II was born to Dwarven prince Thráin II in the mountain city of The Lonely Mountain.
				Early in his youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in TA
				2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he participated in the
				Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He marched with one of the Dwarven armies beneath the East-gate of Moria. At some
				point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch found on the floor as a shield, he gained
				the epithet "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even in death.

            <h3>Fili and Kili</h3>
			<p>
				Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother Dís. They were also nephews of
				Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his long nose,
				the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.

            <h3>Oin</h3>
			<p>
			    Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. Óin's uncle was Fundin, the
			    father of Balin and Dwalin. He usually wore a brown-hooded cloak when travelling. Óin fought in the Battle of
			    Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined with Thorin and Company on the quest to reclaim
			    the Lonely Mountain wearing a brown hood.

            <h3>Gloin</h3>
			<p>
			    In TA 2941, Glóin and his brother Óin, along with his cousins Dwalin and Balin, were among the Dwarves
			    accompanying Thorin and Company during their quest to the Lonely Mountain to recapture The Kingdom of Erebor from
			    the Dragon Smaug. He was noted for his skills with a tinderbox, and, along with his brother Óin, was usually the
			    one told to get a fire started whenever the Dwarves made camp. Gloin also fought in the Battle of the Five
			    Armies.

            <h3>Balin</h3>
			<p>
			    Balin was likely born in the Lonely Mountain before the coming of the dragon Smaug. He had a younger brother
			    named Dwalin, and was amongst those driven from their homes when Smaug attacked the Lonely Mountain. Afterwards,
			    he may have lived in Dunland as a refugee, before fighting in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs which culminated in
			    the Battle of Azanulbizar. Many years later, in approximately TA 2841, he accompanied Thráin II, the father of
			    Thorin, when he attempted to go back to the Lonely Mountain himself, but Thráin was captured and lost.

            <h3>Dwalin</h3>
			<p>
			    Dwalin was the first Dwarf to arrive, alone, at Bag End when the unexpected party planned by Thorin and Gandalf
			    began at Bilbo Baggins' hobbit hole. He was wearing a dark-green hood and a golden belt, his tucked into the belt
			    and walked in as if expected, which greatly surprised Bilbo. Soon Balin arrived and he and Dwalin sat talking
			    while Bilbo kept answering the door for the arrival of more and more Dwarves. Later, when Bilbo griped aloud in
			    his kitchen about the lack of help in setting out refreshments, Dwalin and Balin were the first (followed by Fíli
			    and Kíli) to lend a hand. Later still, when the Dwarves filled Bag End with music, Dwalin played on a viol as big
			    as himself.

            <h3>Ori</h3>
			<p>
			    Ori lived in Thorin's Halls in the northern Blue Mountains for many years. In the year TA 2941, Ori became a
			    member of Thorin's Company and travelled with Thorin, Gandalf, Bilbo Baggins, and the other dwarves on the quest
			    for the Lonely Mountain, culminating in the death of Smaug. Finally, he and the other dwarves of Thorin's Company
			    fought in the Battle of Five Armies, which he survived.

            <h3>Dori</h3>
			<p>
			    It fell to Dori to carry Bilbo Baggins in the tunnels of the Misty Mountains during the escape from the Goblins,
			    but Dori dropped Bilbo, and the other Dwarves and Gandalf blamed him for "losing their burglar." Later, during
			    their escape from the Wargs and Orcs, Dori helped Bilbo climb a tree to get away from the wargs. Bilbo shortly
			    thereafter saved Dori by grabbing his legs as they were rescued by the Great Eagles and taken to their eyrie from
			    the Misty Mountains. When Gandalf tells their tale to the skin-changer Beorn and brings forward the company, Dori
			    came first, along with Thorin.

			<p>
			    In TA 2941, Nori, along with Dori and Ori, became part of Thorin and Company, befriending Bilbo Baggins and
			    traveling with him in search of Smaug's treasure in the Lonely Mountain. After their experience in Goblin-town
			    when the company was pursued by Wargs and Orcs and forced to climb up into some trees, Nori was the first realize
			    that Bilbo had been left on the ground and pointed him out to his brother Dori who rescued Bilbo.

            <h3>Bifur</h3>
			<p>
			    Answering Thorin Oakenshield's Quest of Erebor, he went to the meeting at Bag End with his cousins Bofur and
			    Bombur, where he played the clarinet. On the quest, he was nearly cooked on a spit by trolls and nearly killed by
			    Goblins, Wargs, Stone giants, Great Spiders, and the dragon Smaug himself. A valiant and brave warrior, Bifur
			    never gave up, and fought in the Battle of Five Armies with all his strength, killing numerous enemies. In the
			    fallout of the great battle, Dáin II Ironfoot gave him his share of the treasure, and he retired to live at the
			    Lonely Mountain.

			<p>
			    While answering Thorin Oakenshield's quest to Erebor, Bofur went to the meeting at Bag End with his brother
			    Bombur and cousin Bifur. He accompanied Thorin, Gandalf, Bilbo Baggins, and rest of Thorin's Company across
			    Wilderland to the Lonely Mountain in order to reclaim the dwarves' treasure from the dragon Smaug. Following the
			    dragon's demise, Bofur participated in and survived the Battle of Five Armies, receiving his fourteenth share of
			    the treasure as agreed upon.

            <h3>Bombur</h3>
			<p>
			    Bombur was the twelfth Dwarf arriving at Bag End to attend the meeting arranged by Gandalf, where the quest to
			    reclaim Erebor began. Because he was commonly considered to count for two dwarves due to his girth, he was the
			    last to arrive at Beorn's house and the last to cross the Enchanted stream in Mirkwood. Bombur tumbled with Bifur
			    and Bofur onto Thorin when they first entered Bag End. He chose to stay and guard the camp and supplies while the
			    others moved up the Lonely Mountain, because he trusted neither mountain paths nor ropes to stay intact under his
			    weight. However, he was later forced to use the ropes to escape the rampaging dragon Smaug before he could be
			    slain.

            <h3>Bilbo Baggins</h3>
			<p>
			    As a young Hobbit, Bilbo was curious and eager for news of the outside world. The Istar wizard, Gandalf, took
			    interest in this unusual quality in Bilbo during his visits to the Shire. Bilbo would later remember Gandalf's
			    Firework displays in the dwelling of his mother's family at Great Smials. Bilbo apparently practiced his
			    rock-throwing skills in his youth so much, that birds and squirrels fled the area whenever he bent down to pick
			    up a rock.

            <h3>Gandalf the Grey</h3>
			<p>
			    During his wanderings in Eriador, Gandalf met and befriended the isolated and secretive people of the Hobbits in
			    their country, The Shire. During the Long Winter of TA 2758 Gandalf came to their aid. It was then when he
			    witnessed and admired the pity and courage that the humble Hobbits reserved in their hearts. He then passed
			    onward but nevertheless would return to visit the Shire occasionally and participate in the Midsummer-eve parties
			    of the Old Took, where he impressed young Hobbits with his fireworks, and his stories about Dragons, Goblins and
			    princesses. He was thus known to be "responsible for so many quiet lads and lasses going off into the Blue for
			    mad adventures". He also met a relatively adventurous Hobbit named Bilbo Baggins, although he was in fact far
			    from "adventuresome."
